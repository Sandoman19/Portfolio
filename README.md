# Professional_Portfolio

This page is a portfolio of projects I have done so have in a nicer looking format.
I have used the knowledge I have gained to make the site from scratch this time.

things to do still:
work out how to use bootstrap to make the projects fit better on the page.
  i.e. one left-hand column, then one row with one column, and then two rows with two columns under that (like I have on my first page)
